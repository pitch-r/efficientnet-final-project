EfficientNet is a convolutional neural network architecture designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance while minimizing computational resources. The paper introduces a compound scaling method to balance model depth, width, and resolution, enabling efficient scaling for convolution networks. By optimizing the trade-off between model size and accuracy, the network was constructed based on a mobile-size baseline while still achieving higher performance with significantly fewer parameters.

## Archeology

### Authors and Publication Date:

-   The EfficientNet paper, titled "EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks," was indeed published in 2019 by Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le from Google.

### Context in the Timeline:

-   EfficientNet fits into the broader context of the evolution of image classification models, particularly in the race to achieve better efficiency without compromising accuracy. It builds upon the advancements of notable models such as AlexNet (2012), ResNet (2016), and MobileNetV2 (2018).

### Scaling Strategies:

-   The paper introduces a novel approach to scaling Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) by simultaneously scaling the network's depth, width, and resolution. This is in contrast to previous methods that focused on scaling only one of these dimensions. The three scaling dimensions are inspired by earlier works: depth scaling (He et al., 2016), width scaling (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016), and resolution scaling (Huang et al., 2018).

### Grid Search for Efficient Scaling:

-   EfficientNet utilizes a grid search technique to efficiently tune the scaling coefficients for depth, width, and resolution. This process aims to find an optimal balance that maximizes performance while minimizing computational and memory overhead. This is a critical aspect of the model, as it addresses the challenge posed by the scaling law.

### Advantages of Efficient Scaling:
-   The EfficientNet model stands out for achieving superior performance with similar computational costs. Through a grid search for tuning, it identifies a scaling strategy that is faster, more parameter-efficient, and less memory-intensive, making significant strides in neural network efficiency.

## Visual Explaination (Digrammer section)
In this section we see a graph showing the accuracy to parameter plot of various model when compared to the EfficientNet models B0-B7
![fig1](img/fig1.png)
The graph above are the results of running the model of the ImageNet datasets, where we see that EfficientNet outperforms all the other model even after having significatly lower number of parameters than all the other models. In case of EfficientNet-B7 achieved new state of art with 84.4% top-1 accuracy outperforming the previous SOTA GPipe but being 8.4 times smaller and 6.1 times faster.

### How does this happen?
It happens with the two techniques explored in this paper compound scalling and neural architecture search
## Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks

### Compound Scaling
Before EfficientNets, ConvNets were typically scaled up by increasing only one dimension - depth, width or image resolution. EfficientNets introduced a compound scaling approach that uniformly scales all three dimensions - depth, width and input resolution - using fixed ratios to balance between them. This allows the network to capture more fine-grained patterns as the input image gets bigger. Compound scaling sets EfficientNets apart from prior works and performs better than arbitrary scaling, as seen in results on MobileNets and ResNets in the figure below. Intuitively, bigger input size needs more layers and channels to capture details. So compound scaling works by scaling up depth, width and resolution together in a principled way.
![fig2](img/fig2.png)

The experiments with compound scaling reveal an important insight - balancing all dimensions is key for maximizing accuracy under computational constraints. As the figure shows below, the highest gains come from increasing depth, input resolution and width together. When resolution is higher at 299x299 (r=1.3) versus 224x224 (r=1.0), scaling width leads to much greater accuracy improvement on a deeper base network (d=2.0), for the same FLOPS cost. Simply put, pushing only one dimension hits a scaling limit. With a bigger input image, more layers are needed to process the additional detail, and more channels to capture the richer patterns. The authors succinctly state it as: "In order to pursue better accuracy and efficiency, it is critical to balance all dimensions of network width, depth, and resolution during ConvNet scaling."

### Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
The authors went beyond simply applying compound scaling to existing architectures. They recognized that developing a new baseline model, optimized specifically for mobile applications, would better showcase the power of compound scaling. This led them to create the EfficientNet architecture using neural architecture search - identifying an efficient baseline model tailored for mobile devices rather than arbitrarily picking an off-the-shelf ConvNet. Starting from this specialized foundation allowed them to scale up EfficientNet most effectively. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an automated process to design neural network architectures. It iterates over the space of possible architectures, training child models and using their performance as a signal to guide the search towards increasingly better designs specialized for the problem at hand.

Drawbacks of EfficientNet
-	Training with very large image sizes is slow: 
As the model's substantial memory usage requires smaller batch sizes to fit within the fixed GPU/TPU memory constraints, resulting in a significant slowdown during training.

-	Depthwise convolutions are slow in early layers but effective in later stages
-	Problem from extensive depthwise convolutions (Sifre, 2014).
-	Equally scaling up every stage is sub-optimal
Beause EfficientNet equally scales up all stages using a simple compound scaling rule. For instance, when the depth coefficient is set to 2, every stage in the network doubles the number of layers, which may not be the most efficient approach.

=>	New way to search and scaling


## Societal Impact

Positive impact
-	Widespread accessibility and resource efficiency
Since the network was built based on mobile-size baseline requirements and less parameter compared to previous proposed convolution network, it is suitable for deployment on a variety of mobile devices. This results in the increase of mobile AI applications. 

Negative impact/issues raised by the advancement of Image Recognition for example:
-	Inaccuracy: Humans rely on the result of the model in fields like healthcare is dangerous
-	Legal Consent: Apart from public datasets like ImageNet. Legal issues must be addressed before the use of the application.
-	Others: Fraud, Bias, Ethical consent

## Industrial Applications
![AR Monocle](img/IA.png)
-   Computer vision applications: EfficientNet models have become very popular as pre-trained models for transfer learning in computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, segmentation, and more. Their efficiency makes them well-suited for deployment in applications.

-   Mobile and embedded vision: Because EfficientNet models are smaller and computationally cheaper than previous state-of-the-art ConvNets like ResNet, they are very useful for deploying on mobile devices or embedded systems. This enables smart camera applications, drones, and mobile augmented reality systems.

-   Scalability to large datasets or number of classes: The scaling method used in EfficientNets allows them to scale up to larger datasets like ImageNet-21k (over 21,000 classes) while still maintaining greater efficiency than other models of similar performance. This makes them attractive for handling complex, large-scale vision tasks.

-   Model optimization and compression: EfficientNet's techniques like depthwise convolutions and model scaling based on a compound coefficient make the models highly optimizable for techniques like model quantization or pruning. This further improves efficiency when deploying the models.
